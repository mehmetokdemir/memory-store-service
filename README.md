Written in Golang using standard libraries

##Features
 - Post values with a given key
 - Get the value of that key with a specific key
 - Flush all values in the json file and state
 - Every minute should save the data on the memory to the file
 - When the application stops and starts the program again, if there is a file(tmp/TIMESTAMP-data.json) in place, it should load the updated data into the memory
 - Server log file(server.log) that shows http requests with timing
 - API documentation made with swagger
